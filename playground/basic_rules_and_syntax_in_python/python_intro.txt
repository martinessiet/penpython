WHAT IS PYTHON

Python is one of the numerous computer programming languages that are 
gaining popularity everyday. Python by definition is a general 
high-level language that is easy to learn and even easier to use, 
it's style and philosophy emphasises on code readability and simplicity.
The syntax makes it easy for programmers to write computer instructions 
in fewer lines of code compared to the number it would take to write 
similar instructions in other languages such as JAVA, C++, or C#. 

Python's core philosoply is summarised in the first seven principles that 
govern the development of the language as written in "The Zen of Python"

They read: 
	1.	Beautiful is better than ugly.
	2.	Explicit is better than implicit.
	3.	Simple is better than complex.
	4.	Complex is better than complicated.
	5.	Flat is better than nested.
	6.	Sparse is better than dense.
	7.	Readability counts.


	THE PYTHON SHELL

When you install python, you will have the option to run python script saved
as .py files right from your computer terminal, or you can use the simpler 
Python IDLE integrated development environment. 


	EXECUTING PYTHON SCRIPT

Python scripts have an extention of ".py". When saving your code, be sure to 
specify this, .py, in the filename. It is preferrable that you save your 
excercise scripts with a simple descriptive name with no spaces, example 
"Helloworld.py" and so on. Proper naming of your scripts file eliminates 
chances of errors and confusion when calling them from the terminal.

To run the saved .py scripts e.g."helloworld.py", you will need to know a
few things about navigating terminal. You should know how to change directories (you must always be on the working directory in which the python scripts are 
saved). To run python script example:
		Python Helloworld.py
